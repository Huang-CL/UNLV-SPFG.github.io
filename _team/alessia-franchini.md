She was a postdoctoral fellow at UNLV for two years working with
Prof. Rebecca Martin as well as Prof. Steve Lubow at Space Telescope
Science Institute on dynamics of protoplanetary discs in binary systems.
She used a combination of analytical models and hydrodynamical
simulations to investigate the interaction between gaseous discs and
planets in binary stars.
During her time at UNLV, she also worked with Prof. Martin on the
transients Be/X-ray binaries and developed models that can reproduce and
explain the observed outbursts in these systems.

She is now a postdoctoral fellow at Universit√† degli Studi di
Milano-Bicocca in Italy, where she works mostly on the massive black
hole binary evolution in gaseous environments, using primarily
hydrodynamical simulations.
