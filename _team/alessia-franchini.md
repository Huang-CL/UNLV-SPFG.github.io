She was a postdoctoral fellow at UNLV for two years working with
[Prof. Rebecca Martin](/team/rebecca-martin)
as well as
[Prof. Steve Lubow](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/research-directory/steve-lubow)
at
[Space Telescope Science Institute](https://www.stsci.edu/)
on dynamics of protoplanetary discs in binary systems.
She used a combination of analytical models and hydrodynamical
simulations to investigate the interaction between gaseous discs and
planets in binary stars.
During her time at UNLV, she also worked with
[Prof. Martin](/team/rebecca-martin)
on the transients Be/X-ray binaries and developed models that can
reproduce and explain the observed outbursts in these systems.

She is now a postdoctoral fellow at
[Universit√† degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca](https://en.unimib.it/)
in Italy, where she works mostly on the massive black
hole binary evolution in gaseous environments, using primarily
hydrodynamical simulations.
