Chen-liang Huang (黄辰亮) is a postdoctoral research associate in <a href="https://www.lpl.arizona.edu/">Lunar and Planetary Laboratory</a> at University of Arizona since August 2019. He works with <a href="https://www.lpl.arizona.edu/faculty/tommi-koskinen">Prof. Tommi Koskinen</a> on characterizing exoplanet atmosphere by analyzing its atomic absorption features using an escaping atmosphere model.

He was a postdoc at <a href="http://www.physics.unlv.edu/index.html">UNLV</a> for two years, working with Prof. [Jason Steffen](/team/steffen-jason/) on modeling the interior structure of terrestrial planets.

He received his Ph.D. in <a href="http://astronomy.as.virginia.edu/">Astronomy</a> from UVa in 2017, under the supervision of <a href="https://astronomy.as.virginia.edu/people/pla7y/"> Prof. Phil Arras</a> and <a href="https://astronomy.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/rac5x">Prof. Roger Chevalier</a>. The work in my thesis revolved around theoretical studies of exoplanet atmospheres and supernova remnants.
