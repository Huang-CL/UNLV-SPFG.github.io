## Introduction
As of now, thousands of extrasolar planets have been detected,
indicating the ubiquity of planets around stars.
However, how these planets---including those in our own Solar
System---were formed remain in question.
We generally focus on studying the so-called *core accretion* model, in
which planets are formed by coagulating solid materials, especially in
gaseous environments.

This process takes interstellar, micron-sized dust grains into planetary
cores and hence covers about 13 orders of magnitude in size and 30
orders of mangitude in mass, which needs to be completed before the disk
is evaporated.
Given such a huge difference in length scales, we have to break the
process down into different stages.
We highlight in the following what we have been working on.

## Dust-Gas Dynamics and Planetesimal Formation
Dust particles feel aerodynamic drag force in the gaseous protoplanetary disks,
similar to a moving golf ball in the air. This drag force will lead to dust's
radial and azimuthal drift in the disk. When particles have the right size
so that their stopping time due to the drag force equals the disk's orbital time,
they will be extremely mobile, eithing drifting to the central star or moving towards some
 disk sub-structures.

When a significant amount of dust is concentrated in some disk regions, the dust
can push the gas, altering the gas motion. A gas-dust instability, called streaming instability,
then operates and concentrates dust particles enough to be gravitational bound.
The resulting planetesimals can be km in size.
